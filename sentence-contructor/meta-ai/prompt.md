## Examples

Here are exmaples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score and why example is scored the way it is. 
<example>
    <user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reason>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table, it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginning sentence is unnecesary,  should just jump into the vocabulary table
    - BAD: in the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because the student needs to figure that out
    - BAD: the sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [location][subject][verb],[object][verb=past]?
    </score_reason>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to help you get started:
    |Japanese	 |Romaji	|English
    |            |kuma	    |bear    |
    |            |tobira	|door    |
    |            |gomi	    |garbage |
    |            |noko	|leave behind|
    Now, think about the sentence structure. You can use the following structure as a starting point:
    [Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] imasu. [Subject] wa [Object] o [Verb] [nai] desu ka?
    The first part of the sentence is a statement, and the second part is a question. Try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary table and the sentence structure.
    If you need help or want clues, feel free to ask!
